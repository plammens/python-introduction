# Print: practice

Let's practice a bit using the `print` function.

In the editor, write a program that prints the text `This program` and `prints two lines.`, each on its own line.
When you run it, the output should look like this:
```text
This program
prints two lines.
``` 

To check that your program works, run it with (e.g. using <kbd>&shortcut:RunClass;</kbd>). When you're ready to submit, click <kbd>Check</kbd>.
