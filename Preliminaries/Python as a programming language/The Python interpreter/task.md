# The Python interpreter

Since Python is an interpreted language, to run programs written in Python we must invoke the
Python interpreter, giving it the file where we wrote the program as input. For example, in the
terminal we would run the command
```bash
python myprogram.py
```
where `myprogram.py` is the name of the file in which we have written our program. This executes
the program line by line.

We will be using version 3.8+ of the Python language.

## Language vs implementations

There are many different *implementations* of the Python language, i.e. different
interpreters. But the *language* itself is juts one; every interpreter produces the same output for
the same program written in the Python language.

The standard implementation of the Python language is

, which is what we will be using in this course.
