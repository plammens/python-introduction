# The Python interpreter

Since Python is an interpreted language, to run programs written in Python we must invoke the
Python interpreter, giving it the file where we wrote the program as input.

We will be using version 3.8+ of the Python language.

## Language vs implementations

There are many different *implementations* of the Python language, i.e. different
interpreters. But the *language* itself is juts one; every interpreter produces the same output for
the same program written in the Python language.

The standard implementation of the Python language is

, which is what we will be using in this course.

Before going to the details of how to run the Python interpreter, we will first get to know a tool that we'll need for this (and for many other tasks in any programming or advanced computer usage): the terminal.
