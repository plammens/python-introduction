# Programming languages

A [programming language <img height="14" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/programming_language) specifies a way 
to declare instructions to be executed by a computer. Usually, this means a text-based, "human-readable" way of specifying computer instructions, instead of directly writing 
[machine code <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/machine_code) 
in binary.

Each programming language defines its own set of allowed instructions which produce various
kinds of output.

Programming languages define:
 - **syntax** – the "form" of different language elements: Which characters are allowed? Which sequences of characters form valid tokens? Which combinations of tokens make sense?
 - **semantics** – the "meaning" of different language elements: What does this sequence of tokens mean? What instruction is this line declaring?
 
## Running a program 

 In order to run a program written in a certain programming language, we need to have a way of
 translating that particular language to machine code, which is the "language" that a computer
 can directly execute.
 
 In the next task we will see two different approaches to this.
