# Compiled languages vs Interpreted languages 

Python is an **interpreted** language.

What does this mean?

Roughly speaking, there are two main categories of programming languages based on the type of 
program they use to translate a program written in that language to machine code:
 - **compiled** languages; and
 - **interpreted** languages
 
 
[Compiled languages <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) involve a program called **compiler** which translates a whole file or set of
files written in that language to machine code. To execute a program in such a language, you first
need to **compile** (i.e. run the compiler on) the file where you have written the program, and
then execute the resulting [**binary file** <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file) that contains the machine code.
 
[Interpreted languages <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) involve a program called **interpreter** which simply
executes the instructions in a program line by line, without explicitly translating them to
machine code first. To run a program written in such a language you would simply run the 
interpreter on the file were the program is written (i.e. giving the latter as input to the 
former).

You can think of a compiler as a book translator who writes a whole new book, which is the
translated version of the original; while an interpreter is more like a simultaneous translator
who translates a speech at a conference in real-time.
