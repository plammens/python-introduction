# Strings
**Official docs:** [`str` <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_py.png">](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str) 

Strings are objects that store text. They're a variable-length sequence of text characters.
The type object for strings is `str`.

You can write a string using double- or single- quotes:
```python
"this is a string"  # can use double quotes
'this is a string'  # or single quotes
```

Strings can be empty:

```python
""  # valid string
```

Contrary to other languages, there is no type for individual characters.
You can represent a single character with a single-character string.
