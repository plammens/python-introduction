# Numeric types
**Official docs:** [Numeric types <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_py.png">](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex) 

Numeric types represent numbers. The two main numeric types are integers and floating-point
numbers (but there's also complex numbers).

## Integers

Integers (or "ints") are whole numbers (including negative numbers and zero). The type object 
for integers is `int`. 

See the file open in the editor for some examples of integers. 

## Floating-point numbers

Floating-point numbers (or "floats") are the computer equivalent of "decimal" numbers.
They're not exact decimals though as their precision is limited.
The corresponding type object is `float`. 

See the file open in the editor for some examples of floats.
