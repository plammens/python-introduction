# Sets
**Official docs:** [Set types <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_py.png">](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset) 

Sets are unordered collections of unique items.
The type object for sets is `set`.

You can write a set using a comma-separated list within curly brackets:
```python
{1, "spam", 3}
```

Sets don't contain duplicates, so the following set is equivalent to the one above:
```python
{1, 1, "spam", 3}
```
