# `None`

There is a special object in Python with its own special type. That object is `None`.

`None` is a special value that indicates the *absence* of any object of a "proper" type.
It is used in various different scenarios, but some of these uses are to indicate missing data, or to make a variable "empty".

Since there is only one object with this value, to check whether something is `None` we
use the `is` operator: `var is None`.
