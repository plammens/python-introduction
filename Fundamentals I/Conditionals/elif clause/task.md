# Conditionals: the `elif` clause

If you want to select one of multiple paths of execution based on multiple conditions (instead of just one), you can use the `elif` clause.


```python
if <expr1>:
    <block1>
elif <expr2>:
    <block2>
else:
    <block3>
```


You can insert as many `elif` clauses as you want between the `if` and `else` clauses.
