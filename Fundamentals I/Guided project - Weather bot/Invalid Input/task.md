The next step is to check that the given city is valid.

Line 11 in `task.py` gets the weather forecast from an online service and saves it in `forecast`. 
(There is some behind-the scenes code that is doing this.)
If a city with the given name doesn't exist, `forecast` will be `None`.

Make an `if` statement to check whether the given city name is valid. If it is not, print a message saying `Invalid city name`.

Make sure to run your program to see if it works so far.
