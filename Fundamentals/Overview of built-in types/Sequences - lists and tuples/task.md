# Sequence types
**Official docs:** [Sequence types <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_py.png">](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range) 

Sequence types represent ordered collections of objects (with repetition). 
The two main sequence types are lists and tuples.

## Lists

Lists are modifiable sequences of objects. The type object 
for lists is `list`.

Lists are written as a comma-separated list within square brackets:
```python
[1, "abc", 2.3, 2.3, "hello"]
```

Lists can be empty:
```python
[]
```

## Tuples

Tuples are just like lists, but they're fixed-size and unmodifiable.
The corresponding type object is `tuple`. 

Tuples are written as a comma-separated list within parentheses:
```python
(1, "abc", 2.3, 2.3, "hello")
```
