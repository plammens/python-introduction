# Boolean basics: introduction

**Python docs:** [boolean values <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_py.png">](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-values)

Booleans, which can take one of two constant values, `True` or `False`, are objects that represent [*truth values* <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truth_value) —which we can think of as values for answers to yes/no questions. E.g. the answer to "*Is this car red?*" is either yes or no, i.e. `True` or `False`. 

Alternatively, we can think of truth values as qualifying whether a statement is true (i.e. corresponds to reality) or not. Taking the previous example, the truth value of the statement "*This car is red.*" is either `True`—if the car is indeed red—or `False`—if it is not. A statement that has a truth value is called a [*proposition* <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposition).

In this lesson we will explore some operations we can perform with booleans.
