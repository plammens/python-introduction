# Booleans: comparison

Booleans can be compared for equality as expected:
```text
>>> False == False
True
>>> True == True
True
>>> False == True
False
```


They can also be compared with `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=`. The order of booleans is simply defined as `False < True`.

```text
>>> False < True
True
```

When comparing booleans, you can think of `False` as the number `0` and `True` as the number `1`. (In fact, that's what you get when converting a boolean to a number.)
