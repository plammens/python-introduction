# Statements and expressions

The fundamental building blocks of Python source files are statements and expressions.

Python's unit of execution are **code blocks**. For example, a Python source file is considered as a
single code block. Code blocks are sequences of statements.

A [**statement** <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)) is an atomic "command" that the Python interpreter executes. These are what makes up
a Python program (which is written as a sequence of statements) Statements always take up one
(for simple statements) or more (for compound statements) full lines.

An [**expression** <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)) is a piece of code from which a *value* can be computed. Expressions can appear 
anywhere
within a line (as allowed by the Python syntax) and can be nested in another expression or  a statement. An
expression is evaluated every time it is "encountered" by the interpreter.

You can think of statements as being *executed* and expressions as being *evaluated* (evaluating an expression means computing its value).

All expressions can be used as a statement, but not the other way around.

## Task

The `main.py` file open in the editor contains some examples of statements and expressions.
Take a look and see if you understand the difference between the two!
