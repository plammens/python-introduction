# Comment this

Put your newly acquired commenting skill to the test.

The file `task.py` contains three different statements in lines 5, 7, and 9.
Your job is to add a comment to each, on the same line. Try to find out or guess what each statement is doing, and write that in your comment! Feel free to run the script.

Note: your solution will count as valid as long as you add a comment to each of the lines, but try to make them descriptive! Also note that in a real-world scenario you probably wouldn't add comments to small, individual statements like these.
