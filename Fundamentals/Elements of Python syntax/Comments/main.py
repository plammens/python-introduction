About comments in Python
"""

# to insert one-line comment, use the hash character: #
# everything after # up to the end of the line will be considered a comment:

str(123 + 4.7) + " something something"  # this is a one-line comment

# one-line comments can start anywhere in the line, but they always end at the end of the line
# (you cannot "close" them and keep writing code on the same line) # 123 + 12  <- still a comment
