# Python's data model: Q2

Suppose you want to compare the laptops of two of your friends.
One of your friends has `laptopA`, and the other has `laptopB`.

Supposing that `laptopA` and `laptopB` are Python objects, how would you check
whether `laptopA` and `laptopB` are actually the same thing? 
(I.e. whether your two friends are sharing the same laptop, maybe because they're siblings.)
