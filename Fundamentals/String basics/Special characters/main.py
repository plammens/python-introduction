# ----- special characters -----

# special characters are indicated with a backslash
"\n"  # newline -- to end the current line and create another one
"first line\nthis is on another line"

# quotes in strings:
# since quotes are used to delimit strings, if we try to write a literal quote symbol the
# interpreter will think that we're trying to close the string.
# so we have to prefix them with a backslash too:
'She said "Hello, I\'m Alice"'  # single quote (/apostrophe) in single-quote -enclosed string
"Bob says \"don't do that!\""  # double quotes in double-quote -enclosed string

# a literal backslash
"This is a backslash: \\"
