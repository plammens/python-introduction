# String concatenation

Two strings can be chained together with the `+` operator:
```python
"hello " + "world"
```
The result is a string that contains all characters from the first string immediately followed
by all characters from the second string:
```text
>>> "hello " +  "world"
'hello world'
```

Since this operation is [*associative* <img height="12" style="display: inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webartifex/intro-to-python/master/static/link_to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_associativity), you can chain arbitrarily many strings with this syntax:
```python
"spam" + "eggs" + "ham"  # concatenation of 3 strings
```
