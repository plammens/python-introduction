# Strings: converting to a string

Every object has a string representationâ€”that's what gets printed when we use `print` on something
which isn't a string.


You can explicitly convert objects to strings using the `str` type.
Calling `str` on an object will return its string representation.
```text
str(<object>)
```
For example:
```text
>>> str(object())
'<object object at 0x0000020819C7EFD0>'
>>> str(0.00001)
'1e-05'
>>> str('hello')
'hello'
>>> str({1, 2, 3})
'{1, 2, 3}'
```
