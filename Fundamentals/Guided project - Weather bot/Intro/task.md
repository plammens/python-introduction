# Guided project: Weather bot

Now that we've seen some of the basic building blocks for Python, we can start working on some small but complete Python projects.

This lesson will guide you through the development of a Python program that helps you with the local weather.
The goals of this program are the following.
1. Interactively input the name of a city for which you would like to get weather info.
2. Get the weather forecast for that city at the current time from some online service
3. Produce some output based on certain conditions:
   * If it is likely to rain, print a message saying to bring an umbrella
   * If it is sunny and warm, print a message to wear sunglasses
   * Print a message to wear a particular kind of clothing depending on temperature and weather conditions.
   * If wind speed is very high, print a message saying to not go outside
   
Part 2 will be done for you (as it involves concepts we haven't seen yet), but you will focus on parts 1 and 3.

You will be guided through a sequence of tasks, each building on what you've written in the previous. In these tasks, answer placeholders that you are expected to fill with a single line or expression are indicated with `...`, while those where you can use multiple lines if needed are indicated with `..., ...`.
